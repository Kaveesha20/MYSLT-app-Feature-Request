The app shows many functions, but usability is almost zero. I believe the design to deliver should be based on customer centric. The teams over there should think differently, or people with different thoughts should replace this national company.\n",

They know they have a poor connection and that customers are facing issues, but they act like there's no problem. We're paying, but the data gets used up quickly without proper coverage. SLT is turning out to be just as bad as Lanka Bell. The coordinators and staff at Aluthmawatha are very lazy. They don’t provide any solutions and just tell us to go to the head office because they themselves do\n",

            "Review: Poor app with poor customer service as well. Customer service officers are not trained well to handle customer complaints. I made several complaints via the app and 1212 since 4 days now, no actions were taken to sort out the matter and all they do request customer to call different officers without they attend to the customer matter internally. Instead they scold the customer and specially the technical team in Negombo branch is terrible and not professional at all. Very much disappointed.\n",

I have to close the app from the task menu and reopen it again to check the remaining data or usage. But the add-on data or extra gb data are getting refreshed when i go back and click on the button again. The above issue is making super frustrated sometimes. Please add the reload feature (pull to refresh). Thanks.\n",

The GUI is confusing and more over it flickers when scrolling down, from dark to light and back to dark themes. When you try to pay the bill suprise suprise that also doesn't work! Hence the app is useless! 06/08/2023: 2Y since the last review, still haven't worked on the payment gui. Why cant devos have a look @ MyDialog app a much versatile app when it come to payment\n",

Basic feature expected is not there, like billing details. At minimum the bill details of last three months should be visible in the app (not the bill amount only) because the e-bill service is also a hit and miss affair. Once in a while the bill does not come (I am competent enough to locate the bill if it arrives in to the mail service).\n",

            "Review: Very useless app. Very difficult to understand the contents. Designing and the userinterface is very confusing.No customer care option or any form of livenchat available like dialog to sortout issues. I would like to switch from dialog to slt but bcz of this experience i decided to stay with dialog.on top of this i think slt is the only connection required the invoice number to make payment online with a bank transfer. How do we save a template if the invoice numbers are changing regularly?👎👎\n",

You keep increasing the bills. But, don't care about customer service. Really disappointed. Most of the agents in 1212 call center and SLT teleshops, don't know how to do the job. Though we make complains, we don't get solutions. Try to recruit educated people. Don't give chances to stupid minister recommendations.\n",

But installed this again only because SLT said they'll discontinue the broadband app. But sad to say no improvement at all. Used the google ID to login, but cant even add a connection. The fact that such a defunct app is still listed in the playstore under SLT brand is so damn unbelievable. Who are taking such poor decisions at SLT?\n",

But where it needs the most improvements is the organisation of buttons, its all over the place and is not catogarised. For example; why is there a whole separate section for Complaints, it's not something that users will use all the time (could have been in a sub menu and the section replaced with something more important.)\n",

Since then i am trying many times to sign in to the App which is made necessary, but to my dismay i was unable to do it due to faults of this App. Every time i try it and enter the required OTP number which is sent to my email, your message shows that it is wrong! Sometimes your message say that service is temporarily unavailable. How can i get your service & pay my bills? I am disappointed.\n",

Please check on this and fix it appropriately so that it will be easy for users to check there connection status which also will minimize the call which we take just to set up an application.\n",

Wasting time and can't see the details of mobitel account in same app even they say \"sltmobitel\". They should develop this app accurately and user friendly.

We should be able to check everything from one app. SLT broadband has a bug and even after entering the correct password it says \"wrong password\" ....we have to enter the same password 10-15 times to log in. Useless as ever. SLT is boasting about their quality but they cannot even make a properly functioning app.... Shame\n",
