They know they have a poor connection and that customers are facing issues, but they act like there's no problem. We're paying, but the data gets used up quickly without proper coverage. SLT is turning out to be just as bad as Lanka Bell. The coordinators and staff at Aluthmawatha are very lazy. They don’t provide any solutions and just tell us to go to the head office because they themselves do\n",

But they can't even maintain their own app. If I open the app 10 times per a day- 8 times actually it is broken. Says service is temporary unavailable or some sh**. These days they are giving an Christmas offer with free 50gb social media package for 14days. Even it's free, I can't use it because my main package data is reached out the limit. I mean what's there in free?? Why they've became this cheap?\n",

I have to close the app from the task menu and reopen it again to check the remaining data or usage. But the add-on data or extra gb data are getting refreshed when i go back and click on the button again. The above issue is making super frustrated sometimes. Please add the reload feature (pull to refresh). Thanks.\n",

The GUI is confusing and more over it flickers when scrolling down, from dark to light and back to dark themes. When you try to pay the bill suprise suprise that also doesn't work! Hence the app is useless! 06/08/2023: 2Y since the last review, still haven't worked on the payment gui. Why cant devos have a look @ MyDialog app a much versatile app when it come to payment\n",

For example, when checking the \"unlimited packages\", it's mentioned as \"2 or 4 Mbps\" While I think it should be\"MBps\" The lowercase and uppercase\"b/B\" has 2 different meanings. If the mentioned measurement is correct and that's what we get, then the speed is alarming for 2023. Apart from that, overall app does justice, at least to my needs.\n",

Basic feature expected is not there, like billing details. At minimum the bill details of last three months should be visible in the app (not the bill amount only) because the e-bill service is also a hit and miss affair. Once in a while the bill does not come (I am competent enough to locate the bill if it arrives in to the mail service).\n",

With this new update they have also removed the ability to check your peak and off peak hours at a glace on the daily usage page. I believe SLT is trying on purpose to get us to mismanage our data usage so that we have to buy extra gigs. It's pathetic\n",

You keep increasing the bills. But, don't care about customer service. Really disappointed. Most of the agents in 1212 call center and SLT teleshops, don't know how to do the job. Though we make complains, we don't get solutions. Try to recruit educated people. Don't give chances to stupid minister recommendations.\n",

Another issue is that, most of the time connection signal ain't working well.. which is bit irritating.. Hope y'all fix this asap.

Worst UI/UX ever on a app. Have Improvements like total outstanding, old bill info, last payment, complaints over SLT Broadband but none of those matter because of bad UI. Sign up was messy because OTP is delayed, expired. Kindly suggest you to implement the Mobitel Selfcare UI/UX to MySLT, because the contents are similar only small tweaks can do the trick and Mobitel Selfcare is great App. MySLT need a UI/UX revamp ASAP.

But installed this again only because SLT said they'll discontinue the broadband app. But sad to say no improvement at all. Used the google ID to login, but cant even add a connection. The fact that such a defunct app is still listed in the playstore under SLT brand is so damn unbelievable. Who are taking such poor decisions at SLT?\n",

But where it needs the most improvements is the organisation of buttons, its all over the place and is not catogarised. For example; why is there a whole separate section for Complaints, it's not something that users will use all the time (could have been in a sub menu and the section replaced with something more important.)\n",

Most of the main options are not working like Bills, Internet etc. It has TERRIBLE UI/UX, and functionality is totally messed up.

We should be able to check everything from one app. SLT broadband has a bug and even after entering the correct password it says \"wrong password\" ....we have to enter the same password 10-15 times to log in. Useless as ever. SLT is boasting about their quality but they cannot even make a properly functioning app.... Shame\n",
